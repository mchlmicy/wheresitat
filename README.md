**Description:** Project built for TCNJ's Design Perspectives for IMM class.

**Background:** This was my first experience with Bootstrap and responsive CSS. Much of the code is in prototype form as this was all that was required for the assignment.

**Features:** An interesting take on Isotope JS Plugin (listed posts are randomly colored bricks in a wall [note colors change on page refresh]).

**Demos**
